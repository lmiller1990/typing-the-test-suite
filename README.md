# Typing the Test Suite (Coming Soon)

A brisk course on writing tests with Jest and TypeScript.

## What is this?

A quick course for intermediate level developers looking to get started with testing using Jest and TypeScript.

The first section focuses on using Jest with JavaScript and a bit of TDD. The rest of the course uses TypeScript, Jest, with either Node.js or React. It's 2 hours long and full of content.

We move fast, break things, then write tests to make sure they don't break again. The technologies used are:

- Jest (v26)
- TypeScript (v4)
- React.js (v17)
- React Testing Library (v11)

## Who is this for?

- Developers with some JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js and React experience who'd like to learn to write tests.
- Highly motivated beginner who likes to jump in the deep end.
